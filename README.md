UART communication system with FIFO buffering implemented in Verilog



# UART Communication System with FIFO Buffering (Verilog)

## Overview

This project implements a **UART communication subsystem using Verilog HDL**.
The design integrates a **UART Transmitter, UART Receiver, Baud Rate Generator, and FIFO buffer** to enable reliable serial communication.

The system was verified using **behavioral simulation in Xilinx Vivado**.



## Features

* UART Transmitter using **Finite State Machine (FSM)**
* UART Receiver with **oversampling-based bit detection**
* **Baud Rate Generator (BRG)** for timing control
* **8×8 FIFO buffer**
* Overflow and underflow detection
* Behavioral simulation verification


## Architecture

data_in → FIFO → UART TX → Serial Line (tx)
        → UART RX → FIFO → data_out

The **Baud Rate Generator** provides timing signals used by both the transmitter and receiver.

 Modules
#FIFO (8×8)
* Depth: 8
* Width: 8 bits
* Supports simultaneous read and write
* Status signals:

  * full
  * empty
  * almost_full
  * almost_empty
  * overflow
  * underflow

### UART Transmitter

Finite State Machine:

IDLE → START → DATA → STOP


Serially transmits 8-bit data.

### UART Receiver

* Detects start bit
* Samples incoming serial data
* Reconstructs the 8-bit data
* Generates `rdy` signal when data is received

### Baud Rate Generator

Generates enable pulses to maintain the UART transmission speed.


## Simulation Results

Below are screenshots from Vivado behavioral simulation showing correct UART data transmission and reception.

## FPGA Implementation Floorplan

After successful synthesis and implementation in Vivado, the design was mapped onto the FPGA fabric.  
The device floorplan view shows how the synthesized logic (UART TX, UART RX, FIFO, and Baud Rate Generator) is placed within the FPGA's configurable logic blocks (CLBs) and routing resources.

This confirms that the design is not only functionally correct in simulation but also successfully placed and routed on the FPGA architecture.
